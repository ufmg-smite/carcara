# Carcara

Carcara is a proof checker and elaborator for SMT proofs in the [Alethe format](https://verit.gitlabpages.uliege.be/alethe/specification.pdf). A research paper describing Carcara has been [published at TACAS 2023](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30823-9_19).

## Building

To build Carcara, you will need Rust and Cargo 1.87 or newer. Build the project with `cargo build`.
When running on large proofs, we recommend compiling with optimizations enabled: `cargo build
--release`.

To build and install Carcara, run `cargo install --profile release-lto --path cli`. This will build
the project with all optimizations enabled, and install the CLI binary in `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.

## Using Carcara
### Checking a proof file

To check a proof file, use the `check` command, passing both the proof file and the original
SMT-LIB problem file.
```
carcara check example.smt2.alethe example.smt2
```

If the problem file name is exactly the proof file name minus `.alethe`, you can omit it:
```
carcara check example.smt2.alethe
```

By default, Carcara will return a checking error when encountering a rule it does not recognize. If
instead you want to ignore such rules, pass the `--skip-unknown-rules` flag.

The `--strict` flag will enable a "strict checking" mode. See the [strict
checking](#strict-checking) section for more details.

See `carcara help check` for more options.

### Proof elaboration

You can elaborate a proof file using the `elaborate` command.
```
carcara elaborate example.smt2.alethe example.smt2
```
This command will check the given proof while elaborating it, and print the elaborated proof to
standard output. The `--print-with-sharing` flag controls whether the elaborated proof will be
printed using term sharing.

Many of the same flags used in the `check` command also apply to the `elaborate` command. See
`carcara help elaborate` for more details.

### `lia_generic` steps

By default, Carcara ignores steps of the `lia_generic` rule when checking or elaborating a proof,
instead considering them as holes. However, you can use an external solver to aid Carcara in
checking these steps, using the `--lia-solver` option. For example, running
```
carcara check example.smt2.alethe --lia-solver cvc5
```

will check the proof using cvc5 (more precisely, the cvc5 binary in your `PATH`) to check any
`lia_generic` steps. This is done by converting the `lia_generic` step into an SMT-LIB problem,
giving it to the solver, and checking the Alethe proof that the solver produces. If instead of just
checking we were also elaborating the proof, this would also insert the solver proof in the place of
the `lia_generic` step.

The value given to `--lia-solver` should be the path of the solver binary. Conceivably, any solver
can be used (SMT or otherwise) as long as it is able to read SMT-LIB from stdin, solve the linear
integer arithmetic problem, and output an Alethe proof to stdout.

The `--lia-solver-args` option can be used to change the arguments passed to the solver binary. This
option should receive a single value, where multiple arguments are separated by spaces. For example,
if you wanted to instead check `lia_generic` steps using veriT, you might pass the following
arguments:
```
carcara check example.smt2.alethe --lia-solver veriT --lia-solver-args "--proof=- --proof-with-sharing"
```

The default arguments for `--lia-solver-args` are as follows (note that they assume you use cvc5 as
a solver):
```
--tlimit=10000 --lang=smt2 --proof-format-mode=alethe --proof-granularity=theory-rewrite --proof-alethe-res-pivots
```

### Running benchmarks

The `bench` command is used to run benchmarks. For example, the following command will run a
benchmark on three proof files.

```
carcara bench a.smt2.alethe b.smt2.alethe c.smt2.alethe
```

The command takes as arguments any number of proof files or directories. If a directory is passed,
the benchmark will be run on all `.alethe` files in that directory. This command assumes that the
problem file associated with each proof is in the same directory as the proof, and that they follow
the pattern `<filename>.smt2`/`<filename>.smt2.alethe`.

The benchmark will parse and check each file, and record performance data. If you pass the
`--elaborate` flag, the proofs will also be elaborated (though the resulting elaborated proof is
discarded).

The benchmark results are simply printed to the screen by default. Instead, if you pass the
`--dump-to-csv` flag, they will be recorded in two csv files, `runs.csv` and `by-rule.csv`.

By default, Carcara will check/elaborate each file only once. You can increase the number of runs
using the `-n`/`--num-runs` option. By default, all benchmarks are run on a single thread. You can
enable multiple threads using the `-j`/`--num-threads` option.

See `carcara help bench` for more options.

## "Strict" checking

Strict checking mode can be enabled by using the `--strict` flag when checking. Currently, this only
affects a few rules.

For the `assume` and `refl` rules, if strict checking is enabled, the implicit reordering of
equalities is not allowed in those steps.

For the `resolution` and `th_resolution` rules, if strict checking is enabled, the steps must
provide the resolution pivots as arguments. The expected format is that, for each binary resolution
step, two arguments must be provided: the pivot used, and a boolean argument indicating whether the
pivot is in the left-hand (`true`) or right-hand (`false`) clause. For example:
```
(step t1 (cl p q) :rule hole)
(step t2 (cl (not q) (not r)) :rule hole)
(step t3 (cl (not s) r) :rule hole)
(step t4 (cl (not (not s))) :rule hole)
(step t5 (cl p) :rule resolution :premises (t1 t2 t3 t4)
     :args (q true r false (not s) true))
```

The intended invariant of strict checking is that any proof that has been elaborated by Carcara can
be checked strictly. Strict checking may also improve perfomance.
