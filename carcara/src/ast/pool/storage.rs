//* The behaviour of the term pool could be modeled by a hash map from `Term` to `Rc<Term>`, but
//* that would require allocating two copies of each term, one in the key of the hash map, and one
//* inside the `Rc`. Instead, we store a hash set of `Rc<Term>`s, combining the key and the value
//* into a single object. We access this hash set using a `&Term`, and if the entry is present, we
//* clone it; otherwise, we allocate a new `Rc`.

/// Since `ast::Rc` intentionally implements hashing and equality by reference (instead of by

/// an `Rc<Term>` and that re-implements hashing and equality by value, meaning we can implement
/// `Borrow<Term>` for it, and use it as the contents of the hash set instead.
